## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Pick theme and language from the top bar.
- Use the cards for SVG, raster images, or YouTube.

No backend or installation needed.

## Usage

### 1) SVG ‚Üí PNG
- Click ‚ÄúüìÅ Select files‚Äù in the SVG card or drag & drop `.svg` files.
- Select an item to preview.
- ‚ÄúDownload PNG‚Äù (or @2x) exports the current preview; ‚ÄúExport all‚Äù processes the list.

Notes:
- The preview respects the chosen preset and resize mode.
- Exports are recorded to the local history.

### 2) Raster images (PNG/JPG)
- Click ‚ÄúüìÅ Select images‚Äù or drag & drop `.png`/`.jpg` files.
- Select an item to preview and convert.
- Export single items to PNG/JPG or export all.
- Or paste a direct image URL and use ‚ÄúLoad from URL‚Äù for preview and export.

Resize modes:
- Contain (fit fully, letterbox)
- Cover (fill and crop)
- Stretch (no aspect lock)

### 3) YouTube thumbnails
- Paste a YouTube link (watch URL or youtu.be) and click ‚ÄúLoad‚Äù.
- The app shows a preview (maxres/hq). Use the button to download all resolutions.
- If multiple downloads are blocked, direct URLs open in tabs so you can save them manually.

## Guided Tour (onboarding)

- Starts once for new users (can be restarted via the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù button or Settings ‚Üí ‚ÄúReset tour‚Äù).
- Focus trap keeps keyboard navigation inside the tour; Escape closes.
- Step indicator shows the current position (e.g., 3/6).

## Toolbar note

- By request, the Sign‚Äëin button and User Switcher are currently disabled (commented out). The Help button and Theme toggle remain available.

## Admin ‚Ä¢ Audit & Charts (client-only)

- Admin panel is visible only to users with role `admin` (client-side role; no server).
- Filters (user/action/date), pagination and export/clear options.
- Mini charts: Top events, last 7 days activity, and user distribution. Charts respond to filters.

Note: For real multi-user security and server-side logging, a backend would be required.

## Settings

- Presets: Original, 1280√ó720, 1920√ó1080, 1080√ó1080, 1080√ó1920
- Resize mode: contain, cover, stretch
- JPG background color and quality, and whether to apply it to the preview
- Optional: batch via Web Worker (forward compatibility)
- Reset the Guided Tour

## Export history

- Recent exports are stored in `localStorage`.
- Click an entry to preview it on the canvas.
- YouTube entries prefill the YouTube field; external URLs prefill the image URL.
- Pagination and type filters are available.

## Internationalization (i18n)

- Language dropdown: Deutsch / English
- UI and most statuses update instantly

## Accessibility & UX

- Reduced-motion aware; animated title only during actions
- Themed scrollbars; keyboard and screen-reader friendly labels

## Privacy

- Everything is local to your browser; no uploads
- Export history stays on your device (`localStorage`)

## Browser support

- Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (recent)

Modern features: canvas, Blob URLs, `localStorage`, and smooth scrolling.

## Troubleshooting

- CORS on external images: Some URLs block cross-origin usage. Download locally and load the file.
- Multiple downloads blocked: Allow popups temporarily, or use the direct URLs opened by the app.
- Cross-origin preview export fails: Some operations are restricted; use ‚ÄúDownload all‚Äù (YouTube) or load assets locally.
